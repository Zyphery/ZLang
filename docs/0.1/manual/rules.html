            <p>
                In ZLang, types play a crucial role in defining the nature of variables and data structures.
                They bring a sense of clarity and precision to the language, allowing developers to specify the characteristics of their data.
                ZLang supports a variety of types, including fundamental types like integers, real numbers, and strings.
                Understanding how to work with these types is essential for effective programming in ZLang.

                <h2>
                    Variables
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Variables are containers for storing data values.
                    In ZLang, each variable must be explicitly assigned a type during its declaration.
                    This ensures that the interpreter can allocate the correct amount of memory and perform operations with precision.
                    For example:
                </p>
                <code>
                    # Declare and initialize an integer variable
                    myVar = int(42)

                    # Declare and initialize a real variable with mutation
                    myReal = real(3.14) : double
                </code>
                

                <h2>
                    Defining a Type
                </h2>

                <p>
                    In ZLang, defining a type for variables involves specifying the type and any necessary mutations during their declaration.
                    This is particularly important for achieving precision and clarity in variable assignments.
                    Let's delve into the concept using the real type as an example.
                </p>

                <code>
                    # Declare and initialize a real number
                    a = real(0.78)
                </code>

                <p>
                    Here, a is a variable of type real, representing a floating-point number.
                    The <b>real(0.78)</b> part is a type constructor, and it serves two main purposes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Type Specification:</b>
                        The <b>real</b> keyword indicates that the variable <b>a</b> is of the real number type.
                        In ZLang, various types such as <b>int</b>, <b>string</b>, and custom user-defined types can be used.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>Initialization:</b>
                        The value <b>0.78</b> is the initial value assigned to the variable.
                        This part ensures that a starts with the specified numeric value.
                    </p></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>
                    The <b>real(0.78)</b> construct acts as a concise way to declare a variable with a specific type and initial value.
                    It not only communicates the type of data expected but also initializes the variable with the desired value.<br>
                    For users familiar with other programming languages, this syntax might resemble type casting or conversion.
                    However, in ZLang, it is a combination of type specification and initialization in a single expression.
                </p>

                <b>Explanation:</b>

                <ul>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>real</b>: Specifies the type of the variable as a real number.
                    </p></li>
                    <li><p>
                        <b>(0.78)</b>: Initializes the variable with the value 0.78.
                    </p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The combination of type specification and initialization in a single line simplifies the declaration process.
                    Users can easily communicate the intended type and starting value for their variables, contributing to code clarity and conciseness.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Int
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Integers in ZLang are fundamental numeric types used for representing whole numbers.
                    They can be initialized and mutated based on the desired precision:
                </p>
                <code>
                    # Declare and initialize an integer
                    a = int(10)

                    # Declare and initialize an integer with mutation
                    b = int(20) : short
                </code>
                <p>
                    Here, <b>myInt</b> is a regular integer, while <b>myMutatedInt</b> is mutated to have short precision.
                    The ability to mutate types adds flexibility to variable declarations.
                </p>
                
                <h2>
                    Real
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Real numbers in ZLang represent floating-point values.
                    Developers can control the precision of real numbers through mutations:
                </p>
                <code>
                    # Declare and initialize a real number
                    myReal = real(3.14)

                    # Declare and initialize a real number with double precision
                    myDouble = real(2.718) : double
                </code>
                <p>
                    The <b>real</b> type supports mutations like <i>double</i> or <i>single</i>, allowing developers to fine-tune the precision based on their requirements.
                </p>

                <h2>
                    String
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Strings are sequences of characters in ZLang.
                    They are defined using quotes and can be manipulated using built-in string functions:
                </p>
                <code>
                    include usr/std.zlng # Include the standard library for string tools
                    use zstd # Use the scope or namespace zstd (The main scope of the std.zlng library)
                    
                    # Declare and initialize a string
                    myString = "Hello, World!"

                    # Use a string function to get the length
                    stringLength = string.len(myString)
                </code>
                <p>
                    In this example, myString is a string variable, and the string.len function is applied to determine its length.
                    To use some string functions, you must include the standard library for string tools, and use the scope or namespace <b>zstd</b> to access the functions.
                    The <b>zstd</b> namespace is the main scope of the <b>std.zlng</b> library.
                </p>

            <p>
                Understanding types, variables, and how to define custom types is foundational for ZLang programming.
                Explicit type declarations enhance code readability and provide a clear structure for data representation.
                The ability to mutate types adds a layer of flexibility, allowing developers to tailor their data types to specific needs.
