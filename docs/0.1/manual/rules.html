            <h2>Indentation</h2>
            <p>
                In ZLang, indentation plays a crucial role, mandating either a single tab or two spaces
                for each level of indentation. This standard ensures consistent and readable code
                structures, enhancing codebase comprehension and maintenance. By adhering to this rule,
                developers foster a unified coding style, promoting collaboration and code clarity throughout
                the software development process.

                <h3>Keywords</h3>
                <p>
                    Certain keywords in ZLang require indentation, enhancing code organization and readability.
                    This practice streamlines coding, making it easier to manage and understand complex algorithms
                    and programs. The following keywords necessitate indentation due to the creation of new scopes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"func"</li>
                    <li>"def"</li>
                    <li>"scope"</li>
                    <li>"op"</li>
                    <li>"if"</li>
                    <li>"else"</li>
                    <li>"catch"</li>
                    <li>"iterate"</li>
                    <li>"match"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    When using any of these keywords, developers must indent the subsequent code to
                    define the scope associated with the keyword. Proper indentation enhances code
                    readability and ensures the correct interpretation of the code structure.
                </p>
                <code>
                    # Example of indentation in ZLang
                    condition = true

                    if condition:
                        # Indented block for the "if" scope
                        .out("Hello from ZLang!")
                    else:
                        # Indented block for the "else" scope
                        .out("What a wonderful world!")
                </code>
                <p>
                    In the example, the "if" and "else" scopes are defined by the indentation
                    following the respective keywords.

            <h2>Comments</h2>
            <p>
                Comments are crucial in ZLang for adding explanations or notes within the code.
                The language supports single-line comments (using #) and multi-line comments (using ##).
            </p>
            <article>
                <h3>Single-Line</h3>
                <code>
                    # This is a single-line comment
                    variable = value  # This comment is at the end of the line
                </code>

                <h3>Multi-Line</h3>
                <code>                    
                    ##
                    This is a multi-line comment
                    It can span across multiple lines until the end is reached.
                    ##
                </code>
                <p>
                    Note on Multi-Line Comments:
                    Ensure multi-line comments have both a beginning and an end
                    to avoid unexpected behavior. The order of comment formation
                    is crucial, especially with an odd number of multi-line comments.
                    <br><br>
                    This comment system in ZLang offers flexibility for developers
                    to document their code effectively.

            <h2>Statements</h2>
            <p>
                Statements in ZLang are individual expressions or commands that
                perform specific actions. By default, a statement ends at the end
                of a line or with a newline character (\n). However, developers
                can also use a semicolon (;) to explicitly terminate statements,
                allowing multiple statements on the same line.
            </p>
            <article>
                <h3>Concluding</h3>
                <p>
                    Statements naturally conclude at the end of a line or with a
                    newline character (\n). This default behavior ensures a clean
                    and readable code structure.
                </p>
                <code>
                    # Example of statements ending at the end of lines
                    v = real(42.0)  # A single statement
                    .out(v)         # Another single statement
                </code>
                <p>
                    Each line in the above example represents a separate statement.
                </p>

                <h3>Multiple Statements</h3>
                <p>
                    ZLang supports using a semicolon to explicitly terminate statements,
                    enabling multiple statements on a single line.
                    <br>
                    This flexibility enhances code readability and accommodates different
                    coding styles.
                </p>
                <code>
                    # Example of multiple statements on the same line using semicolons
                    a = 10; b = 20; c = a + b; .out(c)  # 4 statements
                    .out("Hello"); .out("World!")       # 2 statements
                </code>
                <p>
                    In this example, semicolons separate individual statements, allowing them to coexist on a single line.
                </p>
